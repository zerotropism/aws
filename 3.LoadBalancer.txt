### Running Load Balancer under high availability ###

- Objective : run a load balancer offsetting 2 web servers.

- Notable specs :
  - Linux AMI
  - 2 Availability Zones
  - 2 NAT Gateways
  - 2 Security Groups
  - 2 Instances
  - 4 Route Tables
  - 1 Load Balancer
  - VPC :
    - In 1st Availability Zone 
      - 1 Public subnet
      - 1 Private subnet hosting 1 Web Server
    - In 2nd Availability Zone
      - 1 Public subnet
      - 1 Private subnet hosting 1 Web Server

- Steps :

 - i/ Setting up the parts of the system, from Services > VPC :
  - 1/ Create 2 Elastic IPs for NAT Gateways
  - 2/ Create 1 NAT Gateway you will associate with 1 Elastic IP you just created
  - 3/ Setup VPC though VPC Wizard with :
    - Public subnet in Availability Zone 1
    - Private subnet in identical Availability Zone
    - NAT Gateway you will associate withe the 2nd Elastic IP you created in step 1
  - 4/ Setup 2 additional subnets :
    - Public subnet in Availability Zone 2
    - Private subnet in same Availability Zone

 - ii/ Wiring the parts of the system, still from Services > VPC
  - 5/ Setup the 2 already existing Route Tables as :
    - For the one which is not marked as 'Main', you will associate it to the 1st Public subnet as :
      - In the 'Routes' tab, input the Internet Gateway ID
      - In the 'Subnet Associations' tab select the Public subnet 1 ID of your VPC setup
    - For the 2nd one you will associate it to the 1st Private subnet as :
      - In the 'Routes' tab input one of the NAT Gateways ID of your setup
      - In the 'Subnet Associations' tab select the Private subnet 1 ID of your VPC setup
  - 6/ Create two additional Route Tables you will setup as :
    - For the 1st one you will associate it to the 2nd Public subnet as :
      - In the 'Routes' tab, input the Internet Gateway ID
      - In the 'Subnet Associations' tab select the Public subnet 2 ID of your VPC setup
    - For the 2nd one you will associate it to the 2nd Private subnet as :
      - In the 'Routes' tab input the 2nd NAT Gateways ID of your setup
      - In the 'Subnet Associations' tab select the Private subnet 2 ID of your VPC setup
  - 7/ Create a Security Group set up as :
    - Inbound rules allowing HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) and SSH (22) from anywhere
    - Outbound rule allowing all-in protocole

 - iii/ Filling the parts, from Services > EC2
  - 8/ Create an EC2, linux based, t2.micro equipped instance as :
    - Within your Private subnet 1 (thus belongging to the 1st Availability Zone of your setup)
    - Precising under Data User the following script :

	#!/bin/bash
	sudo yum update -y
	sudo yum -y install httpd
	sudo service httpd start
	sudo bash -c 'echo Annoying > /var/www/html/index.html'

Adjusting the string chain between 'echo' and '>' as it will consist the 1st part of your message
This is your 1st Web Server
    - Associate the instance to the Security Group you created in step 7
  - 9/ Create another EC2, linux based, t2.micro equipped instance as :
    - Within your Private subnet 2 (thus belongging to the 2nd Availability Zone of your setup)
    - Precising under Data User the following script :

	#!/bin/bash
	sudo yum update -y
	sudo yum -y install httpd
	sudo service httpd start
	sudo bash -c 'echo Vagueness > /var/www/html/index.html'

Adjusting the string chain between 'echo' and '>' as it will consist the 2nd part of your message
This is your 2nd Web Server
    - Associate the instance to the same Security Group you created in step 7
 
 - iv/ Switch the engine ON, from Services > EC2
  - 10/ Create an Appliation HTTP/HTTPS Load Balancer by :
    - Selecting your VPC created in step 3
    - Selecting the 2 Public subnets of both Availability Zones
    - Selecting Security Group created in step 7
    - Selecting the 2 Private subnets and ADD TO REGISTER

 - v/ Flying the system
  - 11/ Once active :
    - Input the DNS address of your newly created Load Balancer in your browser
    - You should see your first message, refresh the page
    - You should see your second message.
    - You are done.
