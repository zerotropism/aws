### Setup a Bastion-centred structure ###

- Objective : ping www.google.com from Private instance with no public IP.

- Notable specs :
  - Linux AMI
  - 1 Availability Zone
  - 2 Security Groups
  - 3 Instances
  - VPC :
    - 1 Public subnet hosting :
      - 1 NAT instance
      - 1 Bastion instance with public IP address
    - 1 Private subnet hosting : 
      - 1 Private instance with no public IP address

- Steps :
  - 1/ Setup VPC with public & private subnets and NAT instance
  - 2/ Public subnet associated with NOT Main root table with target the unlimited Internet Gateway ID
  - 3/ Private subnet associated with Main root table with target the NAT instance ID
  - 4/ All-in Security Group associated with public subnet
  - 5/ Private Security Group associated with private subnet with source limited to all-in Security Group ID
  - 6/ Setup Bastion instance inside the Public subnet with enabled public IP
  - 7/ Setup Private instance inside the Private subnet with disabled public IP
  - 8/ Through Linux CLI :
    - Acquire & crypt public key :          > local$ chmod 400 {~/{path}/key.pem}
    - Upload public key to Bastion folder : > local$ scp -i ~/{path}/public_key.pem key_name.pem ec2-user@{Bastion_public_IP}:/home/ec2-user
    - Connect to Bastion public IP :        > local$ ssh -i ~/{path}/public_key.pem ec2-user@{Bastion_public_IP}
    - Connect to Private private IP :       > Bastion$ ssh -i ~/{path}/public_key.pem ec2-user@{Private_private_IP}
    - Ping google from private instance :   > Private$ ping www.google.com

- Note : Setup NAT instance root table rule source to all-in Security Group ID including ping protocole
